/**
 * When thrown in the Mustache rendering engine, GRMustacheProxy instances have
 * the same behavior as another object, named their "delegate":
 *
 * Mustache variable tags and section tags, `{{name}}`, `{{#name}}`, and
 * `{{^name}}` render *exactly* the same whenever the `name` key resolves to an
 * object or to a proxy whose delegate is that object.
 *
 * You will generally subclass the GRMustacheProxy class in order to extend the
 * abilities of the delegate.
 *
 * For instance, you may define some extra keys: the `valueForKey:`
 * implementation of GRMustacheProxy looks for custom keys in the proxy before
 * forwarding the lookup in the delegate object. This is the technique used
 * by the PositionFilter filter in the "indexes" sample code (see
 * https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code/indexes.md).
 *
 * GRMustacheProxies provides two initialization methods: `initWithDelegate:`,
 * and `init`. The `initWithDelegate:` sets the delegate of the proxy, which is
 * from now on ready to use. The `init` method does not set the delegate: you
 * must then provide your own implementation of the `loadDelegate` method, whose
 * responsability is to set the delegate of the proxy.
 *
 * **Companion guide:** https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/proxies.md
 *
 * @see https://github.com/groue/GRMustache/blob/master/Guides/sample_code/indexes.md
